# The Capstone (INFO 698)
This repertory contains files of `Capstone Project`.

## Capstone Proposal
we'll use data mining concepts and techniques to extract some specific data from the two datasets. The datasets will be divided into two time periods: before and after COVID-19. We will use R programming to assist in implementing various algorithms or models such as regression, clustering, etc. The data will then be presented using various visualization techniques. 

## Capston Description 
 Create  R analysis to analyze:

  1.  fetal force condition from 2015-end of 2019
  2.  fetal force condition from 2020-2023
  3.  any differences and similarities between the two.
